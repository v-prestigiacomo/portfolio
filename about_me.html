                <p>I have been fascinated with technology from a very young age. Ever since 
                    I got my first desktop computer it quickly became my favorite possession.
                     Since getting my first PC I have taken an interest in video games, 
                     graphic design and my other passion: music production.</p>
                <p>In my mid twenties I began studying at Bournemouth University for a BSc 
                    in Music and Audio Technology. It was here that I was properly introduced 
                    to programming with exposure to C++, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was also
                     at university that I became aware of the practice known as algorithmic 
                     composition - the process of utilizing algorithms to make musical decisions 
                     on behalf of the composer. This combined with my recently new found interest 
                     in computer programming opened up an entire world of creative possibilities 
                     and ever since I have had quite the reverence for programming.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to now, I am currently studying with NetMatters on their Skills
                        Bootcamp which covers: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP and Laravel and I am
                        looking forward to learning more as time progresses.</p>
                <p>I am strongly motivated to continue learning as a developer as I would very much 
                    like to be able to create my own music software in the future which I imagine will 
                    take me beyond the web based languages I am currently studying.</p>
